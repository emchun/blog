I thought this AIGA article was interesting because it talked about how commercial design is changing, and maybe moving away from minimalism as well. While minimalism has been a recent design trend, focused on simple, flat images with sans-serif fonts like Helvetica, 
the article raised the question about if this is changing. In particular, they talked about Chobani's logo, and how it changed from a sans-serif font to one that looks more like hand-drawn lettering, rebranding the company to seem more approachable and friendly.
