description: "AIGA Eye on Design interview with Paula Scher"
---


This AIGA article was an interview with Paula Scher where she talked about how she believes that designers should sometimes work for free. I thought she had an interesting perspective on how working for free gives you more freedom as a designer and helps you become more creative, which is a part of working for free that I have never really considered.
