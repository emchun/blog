I thought this article was interesting because they talked to a movie poster designer about his process and thinking behind some of his posters for <em>American Horror Story</em>, <em>The Beguiled</em>, and <em>Raw</em>, where he explained how his text placement and image choices tied into the theme and feel of each film.
