While doing research for one of my other design projects, I came across this article about Paula Scher - a leader in graphic design - where she talked about her career, her perspective on design, and her process to come up with new ideas. One point that I thought was interesting is when she talked about why design is important, not just for the "public good," but also even commercial design matters because it "raises people's expectations" and gives them a good experience.
